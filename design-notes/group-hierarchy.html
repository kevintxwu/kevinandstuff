          Most designers approach spacing and alignment by tweaking elements until they look right. With a lot of experience, they are capable of creating polished and clean layouts, but the classic method of trial and error seems inefficient. This is an attempt to precisely describe spacing and alignment patterns to help beginners develop their design sense and to help experts work out troublesome details.

      <h2> Thinking of elements in groups </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
          The elements of a layout should be organized in a hierarchy of nested groups. The fastest way to demonstrate this is an example:
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="layout/airbnb.png">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
          Consider <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">Airbnb</a>&rsquo;s website above. This layout is made up of many groups nested within each other. The first layer of groups contains a few large groups of content and a button.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="layout/airbnb-layer1.png">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
          While we organize this page into layers of groups, let&rsquo;s talk about why this organization is important: because it leads us to a set of very useful group patterns:
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <h2> All groups in the same layer should be equidistant </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
          Each of these groups in each layer of the page must be evenly-spaced from each other. We can see this in action in the first layer below.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="layout/airbnb-layer1-spacing.png">
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <h2> All groups in the same layer should be aligned </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
          While whether the groups are center, left, or right aligned is up to personal judgement, if the groups are in the same layer, they must all be aligned the same way.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="layout/airbnb-layer1-alignment.png">
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
          The first layer alone is relatively simple, but let&rsquo;s continue by considering the second layer of groups nested inside the &ldquo;Just for the weekend&rdquo; content.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="layout/airbnb-layer2.png">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
          In the second layer, between only two groups, spacing is obviously equal. However, the spacing between these second layer groups is noticeably smaller than the spacing between the first layer groups. This brings us to our third pattern:
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <h2> An inner layer should have smaller margins than its outer layer </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p>
          Margins refer to the spacing between groups inside a layer. Groups inside inner layers have smaller margins to imply that they are more closely related.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="layout/airbnb-layer3.png">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
          The Napa, Sonoma, and Santa Cruz boxes are equidistant and horizontally aligned. They&rsquo;re closer to each other than to any outer group, like the &ldquo;See All Destinations&rdquo; button.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column-2">
        <p>
          The third pattern has an important exception. It doesn&rsquo;t hold true when considering groups with edges, such as images, cards, or anything else with a border.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="layout/pinterest.png">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p>
          Pinterest is a classic example. Since the pins have borders, the margins inside the pins have no relation to the margins outside the pins. Groups with edges follow a different pattern:
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <h2> A group with edges should have symmetric padding </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
          Padding refers to the surrounding space around the elements inside a group. Groups with edges should have equal top and bottom padding and equal left and right padding.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <img src="layout/airbnb-layer4.png">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
          In a group with edges, like the Napa box, padding matters. In a group without edges, like the overall &ldquo;Just for the weekend&rdquo; content, padding is invisible and thus irrelevant.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="layout/airbnb-layer-all.png">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
          The essential idea is to learn to see imaginary lines like those above. Layouts are not a set of single elements, but a hierarchy of nested groups. Now, you may be thinking: 
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <h2> But isn&rsquo;t this obvious? </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
           In theory, yes, but in practice, even professional designers make mistakes they can easily avoid with group hierarchy. Allow me to purposefully nitpick to explain:
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <div class="column-1half">
        <img src="layout/etsy.png">
      </div>
      <div class="column-1half">
        <img src="layout/google-plus.png">
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
           The first image is the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/" target="_blank">Etsy</a> app. It makes the common error of inconsistent padding. While it&rsquo;s true that bottom-heavy design usually looks better than top-heavy design, the top padding of &ldquo;Home&rdquo; is much too large compared to the bottom padding. Add in the fact that some words like &ldquo;Trending&rdquo; will have letters like &ldquo;g&rdquo; that make the word appear even lower, and you have an undeniably imbalanced button.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
           The second image is the <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/+/learnmore/" target="_blank">Google Plus</a> app. By group hierarchy, the top of the profile image and the top of the comment title should be aligned. A nice side effect of realigning the title of the comments is extra breathing room between the tightly jammed comment title and body.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <div class="column-1half">
        <img src="layout/etsy-original.png">
      </div>
      <div class="column-1half">

        <p> 
           Admittedly, these tweaks are small improvements, but you have to note that these are apps designed and developed by massive teams funded with millions of dollars. If even they are susceptible to a few errors, just how many errors are individual designers susceptible to? Let&rsquo;s conclude by applying these concepts to a less polished app.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="layout/final-wrong.png">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
           <a href="https://schoolsfund-friendsandfamily.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">BPSF</a> is a website that crowdfunds projects for the Berkeley public school district. The layout of the site ignores group hierarchy. I&rsquo;ve highlighted some of the resulting flaws above.
        </p>

           Even with no change to typography, color, or the overall layout, organizing elements into groups and applying group patterns makes a huge difference.
        </p>
      </div>

           In summary, there are four patterns of group hierarchy:
        </p>
        <p class="point"> 
           - All groups in the same layer should be equidistant.
        </p>
        <p class="point"> 
           - All groups in the same layer should be aligned.
        </p>
        <p class="point"> 
           - An inner layer should have smaller margins than its outer layer.
        </p>
        <p class="point bottom-point"> 
           - A group with edges should have symmetric padding.
        </p>
        <p> 
           While we may naturally tend to follow these patterns, it&rsquo;s much easier to design beautiful layouts if we deliberately follow them. These patterns can be applied to pre-existing projects or applied from the very beginning of a project. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column-2">

           Or you can ignore them. That&rsquo;s cool too I guess.
