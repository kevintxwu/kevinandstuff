      <h2> Thinking of elements in groups </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
          The elements of a layout should be organized in a hierarchy of nested groups. The fastest way to demonstrate this is an example:
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="layout/airbnb.png">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
          Consider Airbnb&rsquo;s website above. This layout is made up of many groups nested within each other. The first layer of groups contains the content groups and a button group.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="layout/airbnb-layer1.png">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
          While we organize this page into nested groups, let&rsquo;s also talk about why this organization is important. There are a few very useful group patterns:
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <h2> All groups in the same layer should be equidistant </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
          Each of these groups in each layer of the page must be evenly-spaced from each other. We can see this in action on the first layer.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="layout/airbnb-layer1-spacing.png">
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <h2> All groups in the same layer should be aligned </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
          While whether the groups are center, left, or right aligned is up to personal judgement, if they are in the same layer, they must all be aligned the same way.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="layout/airbnb-layer1-alignment.png">
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
          But the first layer by itself is relatively simple. Let&rsquo;s continue by considering a second layer of groups nested inside the &ldquo;Just for the weekend&rdquo; content group.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="layout/airbnb-layer2.png">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
          In the second layer, between only two groups, spacing is obviously equal. However, the spacing in between these second layer groups is noticeably smaller than the spacing in between the first layer groups. This brings us to our third pattern:
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <h2> A group inside a group without edges should have less spacing than its parent </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p>
          Let parents refer to the outer groups and children refer to the inner groups. Children should be closer to each other than to their parents (ha ha). This is because the closer elements are the more related they are implied to be.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="layout/airbnb-layer3.png">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
          The Napa, Sonoma, and Santa Cruz boxes are equidistant and horizontally aligned. They&rsquo;re also closer to each other than to any outer group, like the &ldquo;See All Destinations&rdquo; button.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column-2">
        <p>
          The third pattern has an important exception. It does not hold true when considering parents with edges, like images, cards, or anything else with an outline or border.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="layout/pinterest.png">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p>
          Pinterest&rsquo;s card interface is a classic example. Because there are edges on nearly everything, the third pattern is invalid. Groups with edges have patterns too though:
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <h2> A group with edges should have consistent padding </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
          Padding refers to the space around all inner elements inside a group. Groups with edges should have equal top and bottom padding and equal left and right padding.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <img src="layout/airbnb-layer4.png">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
          In a group with edges, like the Napa box, padding matters. In a group without edges, like the &ldquo;Just for the weekend&rdquo; content group, padding is irrelevant.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="layout/airbnb-layer-all.png">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
          The idea is to see layouts with imaginary lines like those above. Layouts are not a set of single elements, but a hierarchy of nested groups. Now, you may be thinking: 
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <h2> But isn&rsquo;t this obvious? </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
           In practice, even professional product designers make mistakes they can easily avoid by thinking in group hierarchy. Allow me to purposefully nitpick to demonstrate:
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <div class="column-1half">
        <img src="layout/etsy.png">
      </div>
      <div class="column-1half">
        <img src="layout/google-plus.png">
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
           The first image is the Etsy app. It makes the common error of inconsistent padding. While it&rsquo;s true that bottom-heavy design usually looks better than top-heavy design, the top padding of &ldquo;Home&rdquo; is much too large compared to its bottom padding. Add in the fact that some words like &ldquo;Trending&rdquo; have letters like &ldquo;g&rdquo; that make the word appear even lower, and you have an undeniably imbalanced button.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
           The second image is the Google Plus app. By group hierarchy, the top of the profile image and the top of the comment title should be aligned. A nice side effect of realigning the title of the comments is extra breathing room between the tightly jammed comment title and body. The third pattern is helpful here: the inner spacing between each line in the comment body itself should be no larger than the outer spacing between the comment title and body. Let&rsquo;s see these changes in action:
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <div class="column-1half">
        <img src="layout/etsy-original.png">
      </div>
      <div class="column-1half">
        <img src="layout/etsy-fixed.png">
      </div>
      <div class="column-1half">
        <img src="layout/google-plus-original.png">
      </div>
      <div class="column-1half">
        <img src="layout/google-plus-fixed.png">
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content no-padding-top">
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
           Admittedly these tweaks are small improvements. You have to remember these are apps designed and built by massive teams funded with millions of dollars. If even they are susceptible to a few errors, just how many errors are individual designers susceptibile to? These errors are easy to overlook but group hierarchy is a way to avoid them.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column-2">
        <p> 
           To conclude, there are four patterns of group hierarchy:
        </p>
        <p class="point"> 
           - All groups in the same layer should be equidistant.
        </p>
        <p class="point"> 
           - All groups in the same layer should be aligned.
        </p>
        <p class="point"> 
           - A group inside a group without edges should have less spacing than its parent.
        </p>
        <p class="point bottom-point"> 
           - A group with edges should have consistent padding.
        </p>
        <p> 
           While we naturally tend to follow these patterns, if we deliberately follow them, it&rsquo;s much easier to create clean layouts.
