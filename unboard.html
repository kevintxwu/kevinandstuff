    <p>It all started with a cold email. Though when I had originally sent that email I had known it was a long shot, somehow I negotiated a partnership with the board game publisher <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Indie-Boards-Cards/b/ref=bl_dp_s_web_5535831011?ie=UTF8&node=5535831011&field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=Indie+Boards+%26+Cards" target="_blank">Indie Boards & Cards</a> to build the official mobile adaptation of one of their most popular games — <a onclick="$('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $('#resistance').offset().top - 50}, 500, 'swing');">The Resistance</a>.</p>
    <div class="spacer-1"></div>
    <p>The publisher expected a proper business to form a partnership with, so I rushed to establish a brand, recruit my friends, and register a corporation, founding Unboard. While operating the studio, we also were inspired to create our own original game, leading to our second title, <a onclick="$('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $('#epic-everything').offset().top - 50}, 500, 'swing');">Epic Everything</a>.</p>

    <p>When designing Unboard&rsquo;s visual language, through the sharp pixelated graphics and a strong orange, I intended to convey a message that was playful, but modern and minimal.</p>

    <div class="spacer-1"></div>
    <p>The Resistance is a social deduction board game with millions of fans. Currently, it has sold over 350k physical copies, totaling over $4.5m in revenue. Along with other games like Settlers of Catan and Ticket to Ride, it is a part of the set of titles that sparked the resurgence of the board game industry.</p>
    <div class="spacer-1"></div>
    <p>After landing the contract for the game, I recruited and led a team of developers to build it. Along the way, I also designed the UI/UX and coordinated the beta and general user base.</p>

    <div class="spacer-1"></div>
    <p>Another game we built was a digital card game called Epic Everything. Epic Everything is a game combining the traditional collectible card game and the modern real-time strategy game. To build it, I recruited and led a team of 30 developers, artists, musicians, and other professionals.</p>
    <div class="spacer-1"></div>
    <p>We started a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter, where we raised $40k, but midway through we decided to begin licensing the game. Currently, we have the game licensed as one of the first titles in a board game console called <a href="https://playtable.xyz/" target="_blank">PlayTable</a>. The licensing deal itself has netted us $25k, but we&rsquo;re in talks to convert the license into a full six figure sale.</p>

    <p>We made sure Epic Everything was a storybook world with creatures of all shapes and sizes, ranging from heroic adventurers to misguided robots to mischievous spirits. Along with our diverse cast of creatures, we created different locales and landmarks that appear as interactable environments on the game board.</p>
    <div class="spacer-1"></div>
    <p>Epic Everything, as an original game, truly was a labor of love, but The Resistance was also an equally exciting and sizable project. The assets featured above are merely a glimpse of the work we have put into each game.
